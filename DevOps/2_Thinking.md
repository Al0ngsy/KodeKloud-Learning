# DevOps Thinking and Practices

## Collaborative Development

**Social coding** — using public repositories, code review, and pair programming — improves code quality and knowledge sharing.

## Small Batches & MVP

- Work in **small batches** to reduce waste and deliver value quickly.
- Favor a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** approach to validate assumptions and learn from users.

## Test-Driven & Behavior-Driven Development

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write the test first, then implement code to make it pass. TDD increases speed and confidence.
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**: Specify the system's behavior from the outside in using approachable syntax that improves communication between developers and stakeholders.

## Architecture: Microservices & Cloud Native

- **Microservices**: Organized around business capabilities and independently deployable via automated pipelines.
- **Cloud-native architectures**: Enable horizontal scaling and greater resilience for independently deployable services.

## Embracing Failure

**Failure is inevitable.** Design for failure and focus on quick detection and recovery to reduce customer impact.
