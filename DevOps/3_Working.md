# DevOps Working Principles

**Taylorism** was designed for factory work, but software development is bespoke—more like craftwork. Working in silos leads to mistakes and bottlenecks.

**Team ownership** and **stable teams** make software development more like product development rather than project management.

**Developers** want innovation, while **Operations** want stability.

**Required DevOps behaviors:**
- Shared ownership
- Collaboration
- Embracing change
- Data-driven responses

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Describing infrastructure in a textual, executable format.

**Ephemeral infrastructure:** Can be used and then discarded because servers are built on demand, via automation, using Infrastructure as Code techniques.

**Continuous Integration (CI):** Building, testing, and integrating every developer change into the master branch after tests have passed.

**Benefits of Continuous Integration:**
- Faster reaction time
- Moving faster
- Reducing the risk in integrating code

**Continuous Delivery (CD):** Ensures that code can be rapidly and safely deployed to production by delivering every change to a production-like environment.

**Five principles of Continuous Delivery:**
- Quality
- Working in small batches
- Automation
- Continuous improvement
- Shared responsibility
