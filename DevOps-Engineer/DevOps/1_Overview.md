## What is DevOps?

DevOps is the practice of development and operations engineers working together throughout the entire development lifecycle. By applying Lean and Agile principles, teams can deliver software rapidly and continuously. DevOps is more than collaboration between Dev and Ops — it is a cultural shift and a different way of working.

DevOps has three dimensions: culture, methods, and tools. Culture is the most important of these.

## Key characteristics

- Cultural change and cross-functional collaboration
- Automated CI/CD pipelines
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Immutable infrastructure and reproducible images
- Cloud-native application design
- Container ecosystems and orchestration
- Continuous deployment, monitoring, and observability
